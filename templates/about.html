        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin Oakenshield, a central figure in J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit," is a dwarf prince and a pivotal
            leader, embarking on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and its treasure from the dragon Smaug. Born
            into the royal line of Durin, Thorin is the grandson of King Thrór and the son of Thráin II, making him the
            rightful heir to the throne of Erebor. His epithet "Oakenshield" is derived from an incident during the
            Battle of Azanulbizar, where he used a branch of oak as a shield after his original was broken.

            Thorin is depicted as a complex character, driven by a strong sense of duty, honor, and a deep longing to
            restore his kingdom to its former glory. His leadership qualities are evident in his ability to rally his
            fellow dwarves and inspire loyalty, though his noble pursuit is often clouded by a growing obsession with
            the reclaimed treasure, which leads to moments of stubbornness and pride.

            Throughout "The Hobbit," Thorin's character develops significantly. Initially, he is wary and dismissive of
            Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit chosen by the wizard Gandalf to join their quest. However, as their journey
            progresses, Thorin grows to respect Bilbo's courage and ingenuity, recognizing his essential role in the
            success of their mission.

            Thorin's tragic flaw is his susceptibility to the "dragon-sickness" — a greed that overtakes him as he
            reclaims the treasure of Erebor. This greed strains his relationships with his allies and nearly leads to
            war against the Men of Lake-town and the Elves of Mirkwood. It is only towards the end of his life, after a
            series of dramatic and humbling events, that Thorin comes to realize the true value of friendship and honor
            over wealth. His final moments are marked by reconciliation and regret, as he seeks forgiveness from those
            he wronged.

            Thorin's legacy is one of a noble leader who, despite his faults, plays a crucial role in the resurgence of
            the Dwarven presence in Middle-earth, setting the stage for the events that unfold in "The Lord of the
            Rings." His story serves as a poignant reminder of the dangers of letting pride and material desires
            override more noble pursuits.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli are two of the youngest and most vibrant characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit." They are
            brothers, nephews of Thorin Oakenshield, and key members of the company of dwarves that set out to reclaim
            the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Born in the Blue Mountains, Fíli and Kíli are the sons of Dís,
            Thorin's sister, making them direct descendants of the royal line of Durin.

            **Fíli**, the elder of the two, is often described as having long, golden hair and a blue cloak. He is
            considered one of the best fighters in the group. Fíli is responsible and cautious, often taking a
            leadership role, especially in guiding and protecting his younger brother. His skills with weapons,
            particularly in archery and sword fighting, are noted throughout their adventures.

            **Kíli**, younger than Fíli by five years, shares his brother's adventurous spirit and bravery. He is
            described as having sharp eyesight, which makes him a good archer. Kíli's personality is more playful and
            light-hearted compared to Fíli's more serious demeanor. This difference adds a layer of depth to their
            relationship, showcasing a balance of youthfulness and responsibility.

            Both brothers play significant roles in the journey to the Lonely Mountain, where their skills, bravery, and
            brotherly bond are put to the test. They are integral in scouting missions and in several key battles
            against orcs and other foes. Their close relationship with each other and their uncle Thorin highlights
            themes of family loyalty and courage.

            Tragically, both Fíli and Kíli meet their end during the Battle of Five Armies, defending their wounded
            uncle Thorin from enemy forces. Their deaths are poignant in the narrative, emphasizing the harsh realities
            of their quest and the sacrifices made for their cause. They die as heroes, exemplifying the courage and
            spirit of the dwarf race. Their demise deeply affects Thorin, who regrets the conflict over gold that led to
            such losses, and they are mourned as symbols of the younger generation lost to the ravages of greed and war.
